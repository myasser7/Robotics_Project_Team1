# Robotics Project Team 1 Repository
Welcome to our robotics project team repository, here you will find all codes, files, images and descriptions of our project throughout the semester.
Our chosen application is place and sort robotic arm, where a user presses on a push button, that is pre-programmed with a pre-determined set of coordinates that is translated to a trajectory, an improved approach could involve using sensors, such as colour sensors to sort the containers based on colour, however, that is yet to be confirmed between the team members.
