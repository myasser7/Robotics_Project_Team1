# Robotics Project Team 1 Repository
Welcome to our robotics project repository. This is where we document all codes, files, images, and progress related to our project over the semester. Our focus is on designing and developing a place-and-sort robotic arm system. The current setup involves a user pressing one of the integrated push buttons, where each push-button is pre-programmed with a specific set of coordinates. These coordinates define a trajectory for the robotic arm to place a container at its designated location.
